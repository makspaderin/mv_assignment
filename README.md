# MAX Company API

This simple API is intended to provide its user possibility to create (and edit) companies and then get info about them as a web list.

## Getting started

### If you're running web version from Heroku

Then you just need installed browser and Internet connection.

### If you're running local version from source files

Then you need:

* Ruby 2.4.0+

* Rails 5.0.4+

installed on your system. To run, you should type

`rails server`
or
`rails s` while being in the working directory (*mv-assignment* by default).

Also I strongly recommend to run `bundle install` (installs yet uninstalled gems from Gemfile) and `bundle update` (updates outdated gems). The specific gem which isn't installed to Rails by default is *country_select* - if you have problems, check this one.

## Authors

Each line of code except mentioned in the "extra information" section is written and tested by me, i.e. **Maksim Paderin** - [Profile on GitHub](https://github.com/makspaderin/).

Design was created and implemented by me as well. I used general modern web trend guides for creating it, but as long as it's not a design project, I decided not to do anything complex.

* The motivation to create this API came from desire to learn programming.
